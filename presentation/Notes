Present game -> dp -> abm as a logical process

Simplest possible game -> more complex game -> too complex to analyse game -> simplify to DP -> but population, info sharing -> ABM

Presentation

15 minutes, so... 12 slides

Motivation 1
	Domain: why doesn't everybody get help? What should we do about that?
	Methods: can ABM be an effective way to merge data sources?
Model 2
	ARA
		Interested in the *process* not just the outcomes, so gonna build an ABM
	Graph
Data
	* Want to as far as possible peg the model to reality
	Parameters
		Sources
		Methods
	Validation
Results
	Sensitivity
	Fitting
	Perturbation
